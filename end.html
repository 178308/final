            <p>We would like to express our gratitude for your excellent coverage of our grand opening.
                 The positive exposure you gave our firm on the local news segment provided the community
                 with a nice introduction to our goals and services. The entire staff appreciated the 
                 professionalism with which your news team handled both the interview on our premises and 
                 the final studio presentation. Customer response has dramatically increased since your 
                 We hope to maintain this upward momentum with quality service at reasonable prices.
                 As one of the smaller firms in this area, we are indeed grateful for your willingness to include us in your coverage.
                 Please extend our thanks to everyone involved.</p>
